# Description

## Objectives of the Demonstration Project

The aim of the demonstration project is to test the process of robotic screw fastening of acoustic panels with different configurations, considering the different dimensions of the panels, the number of screws to be installed and their installation. Considering the number of silence rooms to be produced and the projected increase in production volume, it is important to shorten the production time. One of the possible ways of achieving this is to move towards automation-robotic production.
This demonstration project links robotics (UR10 collaborative robot), automation (screw feeder, automatic screwdriver, intelligent jig), AI tools (digital workstation, machine vision tools, robot trajectory simulation).
Although many components are available separately on the market, there is no comprehensive solutions (integration) and methodology to make it fit to the company’s processes. The solution will consider the company’s specific production processes and requirements for the parameters of the acoustic panels, as well as the possibilities for implementing fully automated production (batch production) in the company or for deployment in other companies in the sector. Possible expected results: realization of a product assembly operation in the company, development of an assembly cell concept, selection of a suitable robot to carry out the assembly operation, selection of tools, simulation and testing.

## Activities and Results of the Demonstration Project
Main activities of the project:
1. Analysis of the current situation in the company and specification of the technical task (how the product is linked to the production flow, how the product is assembled, the time needed to assemble it, assessment of the possibilities for robotisation).
2. Development of a robotic assembly (screwing) workstation concept and definition of a specific application in the company (design of a robotic system in a simulation environment, selection of robot and instruments, proposal of an assembly cell concept).
3. Use of machine vision to achieve flexibility and increased production capacity (in screwing, this is the approach needed to identify hole locations).
4. Realisation of the prototype (Test Before Invest) solution in the company and its testing (robot + product + cell simulation in a virtual environment, system assembly in the company, testing of the robot and accessories).
5. Analysis of test results and validation of results (collection of data on the results of the demo project, analysis of the data, proposals for further development).
6. Drafting a general description of the concept of the central business solution (describing the solution in terms of the product and the business process and completing the simulation).
7. Publication of the results of the demo project and preparation of the project documentation.



### Challenge

One of the challenges that this demonstration project aims to address is the robotic production of acoustic panels to shorten the manufacturing time. As the assembly of acoustic panels is one of the most important and labor-intensive steps in the production process, the total time required to manufacture the product is directly related to the performance of the workstation.
